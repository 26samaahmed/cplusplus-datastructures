## BigO is the complexity of my code
- O(1): This is constant time where there is only 1 step. Printing an element in an array for example
- O(n): This is Linear time where n is the number of items in the array. If there are a 10 items in an array, then I would be printing a 10 items.
- O(n^2): This is quadratic time. A nested for loop is an example. The outer loop runs n times and the inner loop runs n times. If an array has 10 items and I'm using a nested for loop, then I would be printing a 100 items.
- O(2^n): This is when the runtime doubles as the input size increases.
